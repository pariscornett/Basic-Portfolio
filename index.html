            <p>Paris is a graduate of East Tennessee State University, and has a BA in English Literature. Her first loves-- books, storytelling and the art of critical thinking-- have led her on a journey toward chasing creativity, freedom and autonomy in her professional life. She is currently enrolled in Vanderbilt Coding Boot Camp in an effort to learn how to program and further her professional skill set. Paris isn't great at talking about herself, but realizes that it's important to show the text in this box will wrap, so here is some additional text to showcase the layout and styling of this web page.</p>
